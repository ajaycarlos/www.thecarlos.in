  {
    "fact": "ATP is the 'energy currency' of all life on Earth.",
    "explanation": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a molecule that stores and transports chemical energy within cells. It powers nearly all cellular processes, from muscle contraction to DNA replication."
  },
  {
    "fact": "Diamond and graphite are both made of pure carbon.",
    "explanation": "They are 'allotropes' of carbon, meaning their atoms are arranged differently. In diamond, atoms form a strong tetrahedral lattice, making it hard. In graphite, they form weak, flat sheets, making it soft."
  },
  {
    "fact": "The pH scale measures acidity or alkalinity.",
    "explanation": "It's a logarithmic scale from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water), below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is alkaline (or basic). Each whole number represents a tenfold change in acidity."
  },
  {
    "fact": "Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element.",
    "explanation": "While all isotopes of an element have the same number of protons, they have different numbers of neutrons. Unstable isotopes, like Carbon-14, are radioactive and are used for 'radiometric dating'."
  },
  {
    "fact": "Cherenkov radiation is the blue glow seen in nuclear reactors.",

  },
  {
    "fact": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) organizes code around 'objects'.",
    "explanation": "This programming paradigm bundles data and the methods that operate on that data into objects. It's based on concepts like inheritance and polymorphism to create modular and reusable code."

  },
  {
    "fact": "A 'light echo' is light from an explosion reflecting off interstellar dust.",
    "explanation": "When a star explodes as a supernova, the initial flash of light can reflect off clouds of dust far from the star. This reflected light reaches us later, creating a beautiful expanding 'echo' of the event."
  },
  {
    "fact": "Horizontal gene transfer allows bacteria to share genetic material.",
    "explanation": "Unlike vertical transfer from parent to offspring, bacteria can pass genes directly to one another, even across species. This is a primary mechanism for the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance."
  },
  {
    "fact": "A polymer is a large molecule made of many repeating smaller units.",

  },
  {
    "fact": "Newton's first law of motion is the law of inertia.",
    "explanation": "It states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This is why you feel pushed back in your seat when a car accelerates."
  },
  {
    "fact": "The process of fossilization is extremely rare.",
    "explanation": "For an organism to become a fossil, it must be buried quickly in sediment to protect it from decay and scavengers. Only a tiny fraction of all life that has ever existed has been preserved as fossils."
  },
  {
    "fact": "A tokamak is a device designed to harness the energy of nuclear fusion.",

  },
  {
    "fact": "The 'Great Filter' is a hypothetical barrier to the evolution of intelligent life.",
    "explanation": "In the context of the Fermi Paradox, the Great Filter is a proposed step in the development of life that is extremely difficult or impossible to overcome, which could explain why we haven't found any other intelligent civilizations."
  },
  {
    "fact": "Ocean gyres are large systems of rotating ocean currents.",
    "explanation": "Driven by winds and the Coriolis effect, these massive whirlpools play a crucial role in circulating water and heat around the globe. They are also where large garbage patches, like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, accumulate."
  },
  {
    "fact": "The Casimir effect is a physical force arising from a quantized field.",
    "explanation": "It predicts that two uncharged, parallel plates in a vacuum will experience an attractive force. This is because fewer virtual particles can exist between the plates than outside them, creating a pressure difference."
  },
  {
    "fact": "Some AI can predict aftershocks better than traditional models.",

  },
  {
    "fact": "The first exoplanets were discovered orbiting a pulsar.",
    "explanation": "In 1992, astronomers found planets orbiting the neutron star PSR B1257+12. This was a surprise, as it was thought that planets could not survive the supernova explosion that creates a pulsar."
  },
  {
    "fact": "The Coriolis effect deflects moving objects on a rotating body.",
    "explanation": "On Earth, this effect causes storms to spin counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. It also affects ocean currents and long-range projectile trajectories."

  {
    "fact": "A 'proxy server' acts as an intermediary for requests from clients.",
    "explanation": "When you use a proxy, your internet traffic goes through the proxy server first. This can be used to hide your IP address, bypass geo-restrictions, or enforce security policies on a network."
  },
  {
    "fact": "The Sun's corona is much hotter than its surface.",
    "explanation": "The corona, the outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere, can reach over a million degrees Celsius, while the surface (photosphere) is only about 5,500 °C. The mechanism that heats the corona is still an area of active research."
  },
  {
    "fact": "The 'Goldilocks principle' applies to more than just astrobiology.",
    "explanation": "The idea of something being 'just right'—not too hot, not too cold—is used in psychology, economics, and developmental biology to describe a desirable middle ground between two extremes."
  },
  {
    "fact": "Some animals are 'piebald', having patches of unpigmented skin or fur.",
    "explanation": "This pattern is caused by a genetic condition called leucism, which results in a partial loss of pigmentation. It's different from albinism, which is a total lack of pigment."
  },
  {
    "fact": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) involve two competing neural networks.",
    "explanation": "A 'generator' network creates fake data (like images), while a 'discriminator' network tries to distinguish the fake data from real data. They train each other, leading to the creation of highly realistic synthetic content."
  },
  {
    "fact": "The term 'algorithm' is derived from the name of a Persian mathematician.",
    "explanation": "It comes from the name of Al-Khwarizmi, a 9th-century scholar whose work introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals and algebra to European mathematics."
  },
  {
    "fact": "A 'planetary nebula' has nothing to do with planets.",
    "explanation": "It is an expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from a dying red giant star. Early astronomers with small telescopes thought their round shapes resembled planets, hence the name."
  },
  {
    "fact": "The 'double-slit experiment' is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.",
    "explanation": "It demonstrates that particles like electrons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. When not observed, they act like waves and pass through both slits at once, but when observed, they act like particles and pass through only one."
  },
  {
    "fact": "The appendix may not be useless after all.",
    "explanation": "While long considered a vestigial organ, recent evidence suggests the appendix may act as a 'safe house' for beneficial gut bacteria, helping to repopulate the gut after an illness."
